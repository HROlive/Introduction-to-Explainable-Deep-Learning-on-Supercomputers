## Description

Throughout the course, participants will develop a solid foundational understanding of XAI, primarily emphasizing how XAI methodologies can expose latent
biases in datasets and reveal valuable insights.
The course starts with a broad overview of XAI, setting the stage for a deep dive into cutting-edge model-agnostic interpretation techniques. As the course progresses, we shift our focus to model-specific post-hoc interpretation methods. Through immersive training, participants will learn to interpret machine learning algorithms and unravel the intricacies of deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformers. They will also become skilled in applying these techniques to various data formats, encompassing tabular data, images, and 1D data.
In addition to theoretical insights, participants will engage in hands-on practical sessions to apply these techniques effectively.
Take advantage of this opportunity to enhance your expertise in XAI and acquire the skills needed to navigate the intricate landscape of AI interpretability. Enroll now and unlock the potential of XAI!

This repository provides a collection of self-explanatory tutorials for different model-agnostic and model-specific XAI methods. Each tutorial comes in a Jupyter Notebook with practical exercises. In addition, we provide useful background information on those methods in this documentation.

## Requirements and Setup

It is possible to either create an environment and install all the necessary packages locally (using the requirements.txt file) or to execute the notebooks on the browser, by clicking the 'Open in Colab' button. This second option doesn't require any further installation, but the user must have access to a Google account.

If you prefer to run the notebooks on your device, create a virtual environment using the requirements.txt file:
```
conda create -n XAI-Course-2024 python=3.9
conda activate XAI-Course-2024
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once your environment is created, clone `Juelich-2024` brach branch of the repo using the following command:

```
git clone --branch Juelich-2024 https://github.com/HelmholtzAI-Consultants-Munich/XAI-Tutorials.git
```
